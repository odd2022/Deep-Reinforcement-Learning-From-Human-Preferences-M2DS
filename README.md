# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-From-Human-Preferences-M2DS

This repo shows our work on the article[Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human
Preferences](https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/),
based on the paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf>.

To structure our code, we inspired ourselves from the pages [Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences](https://github.com/mrahtz/learning-from-human-preferences) and [Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/learning-from-human-preferences). 
However, we created a simpler s, compatible with a recent version of python and torch (the work done in this two github repos is done in python 3.7 and tensorflow)

We focused on the Atari Game "Pong"
